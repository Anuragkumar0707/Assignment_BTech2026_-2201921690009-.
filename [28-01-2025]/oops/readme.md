# Problem Statement:
You are given three classes A, B and C. All three classes implement their own version of func.
You need to modify the class D and implement the function update_val which sets D's val to new_val by manipulating the value by only calling the func defined in classes A, B and C.

## Platform used:
HackerRank
## Approach:
Using multiple inheritance and initialize the initial value of new_value with 1.
